# gauss_jorden_method
The Gauss-Jordan Method is similar to Gaussian Elimination, except that the entries both above and below each pivot are targeted (zeroed out). After performing Gaussian Elimination on a matrix, the result is in row echelon form. After the Gauss-Jordan Method, the result is in reduced row echelon form.
